------------------------------------------------------------------------

`loggit` is an [`ndJSON`](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) logging library
for R software. It is blazingly fast when writing logs, and has _zero_ external
dependencies. `loggit` can be as simple and unobstrusive as you'd like, or as
involved as your application needs it to be.

Please see below for some quick examples, and [read the
vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/loggit/vignettes/) for the
Getting Started guide, as well as some other use case examples.

Why use `loggit`?
-----------------

There are indeed several logging packages available for R. `loggit`, however,
takes a more modern approach approach to logging in R:

- Opting to use the JSON format, which is parsable by most modern software
- Designed with log streams in mind
- Unobtrusive, yet highly flexible
- Convenient ability to log data, then analyze that log data on the same host.

Additionally, the boilerplate to get going with `loggit` is minimal at worst,
only requiring you to point to the log file. If deploying your R code in a
container ecosystem, you don't even need to do that, since `loggit` will
echo its formatted logs to `stdout`. No need to write custom formatters,
handlers, levels, etc. -- ***just f&ck#n' loggit!***

Quick Examples
--------------

The quickest way to get up & running with `loggit` is to... do nothing special.
`loggit`'s simplest functionality does its best to stay out of your way. You'll
probably want to point it to a log file, though; otherwise, logs will print to
the console, but land in a tempfile.

```{r handlers}
library(loggit)
# set_logfile("./loggit.log")

message("This is a message")
warning("This is a warning")
# stop("This actually throws a critical error, so I'm not actually going to run it here :)"))
#> {"timestamp": "2020-05-31T20:59:33-0500", "log_lvl": "ERROR", "log_msg": "This actually throws a critical error, so I'm not actually going to run it here :)"}

```

You can suppress each part of the console output separately (both the `loggit`
ndJSON and the regular R output) but the default is to post both. Only the
ndJSON is written to the log file.

You can also use the `loggit()` function directly to compose much more custom
logs, including ***entirely custom fields*** (and prevent throwing actual status
codes until you wish to handle them). `loggit` doesn't require that you set
custom logger objects or anything like that: just throw whatever you want at it,
and it'll become a structured log.

```{r loggit}
loggit("ERROR", "This will log an error - but not actually throw one yet", rows = nrow(iris), anything_else = "you want to include")

# Read log file into data frame to implement logic based on entries
logdata <- read_logs()
print(logdata)
if (any(logdata$log_lvl == "ERROR")) {
  print("Errors detected somewhere in your code!") # but you can throw a stop() here, too, for example
}
```

Again, [check out the
vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/loggit/vignettes/) for more
details!

Installation
------------

You can install the latest CRAN release of `loggit` via
`install.packages("loggit")`.

Or, to get the latest development version from GitHub --

Via [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

    devtools::install_github("ryapric/loggit")

Or, clone & build from source:

    cd /path/to/your/repos
    git clone https://github.com/ryapric/loggit.git loggit
    make install

To use the most recent development version of `loggit` in your own package, you
can include it in your `Remotes:` field in your DESCRIPTION file:

    Remotes: github::ryapric/loggit

Note that packages being submitted to CRAN *cannot* have a `Remotes` field.
