Package: loggit
Title: Effortless Exception Logging in R
Description:
    A very simple and easy-to-use set of suspiciously-familiar functions. loggit
    provides a set of wrappings for base R's message(), warning(), and stop()
    functions that maintain identical functionality, but also log the handler
    message to a JSON log file. While mostly automatic, powerful custom logging
    is available via these handlers' logging function, loggit(), which is also
    exported for use. No change in existing code is necessary to use this
    package.
