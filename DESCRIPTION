Package: loggit
Title: Effortless Condition Logging in R
Description:
    A very simple and easy-to-use set of suspiciously-familiar functions. A set
    of wrappings for base R's message(), warning(), and stop() functions that
    maintain identical functionality, but also log the exception handler's
    message to a log file. The logging function that the new handlers call,
    loggit(), is exported as well, to provide powerful customization over the
    structure of your logs. No change in existing code is necessary to use this
    package.
