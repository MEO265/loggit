Package: loggit
Title: Effortless Condition Logging in R
Description: A very simple and easy-to-use set of suspiciously-familiar
    functions. A set of wrappings for base R's message(), warning(), and stop()
    functions that maintain identical functionality, but also log the handler
    message to a log file. No change in existing code is necessary to use this
    package.
