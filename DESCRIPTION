Package: loggit
Title: Easy-to-use, dependencyless Logger for R
Description:
    An easy-to-use 'ndjson' (newline-delimited 'JSON') logger.
    It provides a set of wrappings for base R's message(), warning(), and
    stop() functions that maintain identical functionality, but also log
    the handler message to an 'ndjson' log file.
    No change in existing code is necessary to use this package, and should
    only require additions to fully leverage the power of the logging system.
